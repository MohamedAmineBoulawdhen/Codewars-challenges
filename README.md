# Codewars-challenges

## Objective
The goal of this challenge is to earn a total of 300 points by solving problems on CodeWars.

## Instructions
- 150 points can be earned from a set of pre-selected problems covering fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data types.
- 150 points can be earned freely by solving problems of your choice, with different levels of difficulty rewarding different amounts 
of points (2, 8, 32, and 128 points for the most difficult problems).

The pre-selected problems are beginner-level and each solution is worth 2 points. The full list of selected problems can be found [here](https://github.com/MohamedAmineBoulawdhen/Codewars-challenges/blob/main/CodeWars%20Kata%20Challenge.xlsx).

It's important to note that some points are automatically given for ranking up and other activities not necessarily related to problem-solving. 
A complete explanation of the points system can be found [here](https://docs.codewars.com/gamification/).

## Time Complexity
The time required to complete these challenges will vary based on your skills and the problems you choose to solve (took me two days).

## Conclusion
This challenge is a great opportunity to solidify your understanding of basic concepts and to challenge yourself by solving more advanced problems. Good luck!
